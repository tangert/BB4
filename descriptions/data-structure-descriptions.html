        <div id = "linkedlist">
            A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
        </div>
    
        <div id = "graph">
            A graph consists of a set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.
        </div>
        
        <div id = "stack">
            A stack is a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
        </div>
        
        <div id = "queue">
            A queue is a collection of elements in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.
        </div>
        
        <div id = "tree">
           A tree simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
