# BB4

This is a website I made to both help prepare for technical interviews, and to help OTHERS prep for interviews. It's appropriately dubbed "Beat the Big 4."

This is also the first legit website I've pretty much ever made, so it was a great experience to learn jQuery, JavaScript, and other frontend frameworks.

Technologies used in particular: 
 - Bootstrap
 - jQuery
 - Highlight.js: syntax highlighting 
 
Everythign else is vanilla JS and HTML/CSS.

Enjoy and visit bb4.io to see it in action!
